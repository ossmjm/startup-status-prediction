# Startup Companies Status Prediction using Deep Neural Network

## Overview
This notebook focuses on predicting the status of startup companies, whether they are acquired or closed, using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The notebook begins with data preprocessing, handling missing values, changing column data types, and leveraging the WandB library as a callback for model monitoring.

## Repository Contents

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and transform column data types to prepare the data for the neural network.

2. **Deep Neural Network (ANN):**
   - Implement an DNN for predicting the status of startup companies.

3. **WandB Integration:**
   - Integrate WandB (Weights and Biases) as a callback for monitoring and visualizing the model's performance.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure the startup companies dataset is available and structured with relevant features.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Run the data preprocessing script to handle missing values and transform column data types.

3. **Deep Neural Network:**
   - Execute the DNN script to train and evaluate the model for predicting startup status.

4. **WandB Integration:**
   - Configure and run WandB integration to monitor the training process and visualize the model's performance.

Predicting the status of startup companies can aid investors and entrepreneurs in making informed decisions. Happy predicting! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
